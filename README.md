# Knowledge Decay Predictor

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting how quickly a learner may forget a topic if it is not revised regularly. Human memory naturally decays over time, and this system aims to model that behavior using machine learning.

The system analyzes factors such as time since last revision, number of revisions, difficulty level, and past performance to estimate memory retention and recommend when a topic should be revised.

## Why This Project?
Most learning systems only focus on predicting scores or classifying performance. This project is different because it models the *forgetting process itself* and provides personalized revision recommendations.

This makes the system more practical for real-world learning and long-term retention.
